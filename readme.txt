Ceed
----
Ceed is a tiny open source compiler for x86 Linux and Windows. It can compile
a high level language source code into ELF or PE executable. Design and
implementation of Ceed is described at: http://logicpundit.com/blog/ceed


Folders
-------
src - Contains source code for Ceed compiler
tst - Contains some test program for Ceed compiler
lib - Contains asm code for functions injected in Ceed output


Compile
-------
// Linux or Cygwin
cd src
make ceed


Usage
-------
To create ELF executable: ./ceed < <input>
To create PE executable: ./ceed -pe < <input>


Example
-------
./ceed < math.e


Notes
-----
- Only 32-bit Linux and Windows are supported
- Code generated by Ceed is sub-optimal and may contain bugs. Only use for
  learning purpose.
